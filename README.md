# Pairing-Integers
To run the application you can run:
```
ts-node app.ts
```
However, I would recommend just running the tests and passing your trails in through that. 

To run tests run:
```
npm test
```
This should output with 6 tests passing, with a few outputs into the console of Input is not an integer... from the app.ts code.

## Brief
I have created a module with an algorithm to find all pairs of integers within an array that sum to a specified value. My points for success were:

-The input includes the array of integers and the specified value
-The output includes all pairs of integers that sum to that specified value
-Errors are handled
-Unit tests are used to ensure code functionality

This was written in TypeScript to show off some of my knowledge of that language.
